## Storage Accounts
- Fundamental building blocks for data storage in Azure, offering secure, scalable cloud storage for a wide range of data objects.

### Key Benefits
- High Availability and Durability: Provides multiple redundancy options that allow data to be replicated across different data centers or even across regions to ensure maximum availability and durability.
- Security: Stored data is automatically encrypted using storage service encryption and various authorization methods are available such as storage keys, SAS and Entra ID.
- Scalability and Management: Managed as a platform service, it automatically adjusts to your performance and storage needs, making it an ideal solution for both small and large-scale applications.
- Access: Secure access via HTTP(S) is provided through Microsoft SDks, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI and REST APIs, ensuring seamless integration with your applications.

### Performance tiers
- Standard: Uses magnetic drives to offers cost-effective storage for workloads that do not require high throughput and low latency.
- Premium: Uses solid-state drives for high-performance workloads, making it ideal for databases and high-processing applications.


Azure Storage accounts are versatile. They can be used to support various data types and scenarios such as: Virtual machine storage, unstructured data and Structured data.
